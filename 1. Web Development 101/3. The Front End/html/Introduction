Anatomy of a CSS ruleset:

p {
	color: red;
}

where: 
p is the selector
color is the property
and red is the property value

Selector
This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled 
(in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.

Declaration
This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.

Properties
These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.)
In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.

Property value
To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of 
many possible appearances for a given property.  (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)

You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. 
Separate multiple selectors by commas.
