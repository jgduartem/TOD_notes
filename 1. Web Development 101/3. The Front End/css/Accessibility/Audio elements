The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, 
and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence 
on the tag turns the setting on.

Here's an example:

<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
