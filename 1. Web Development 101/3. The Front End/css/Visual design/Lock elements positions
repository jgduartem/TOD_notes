The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to 
its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document,
so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust 
the position.

One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. 
If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser
will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.

The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that 
locks an element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset 
properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" 
where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move 
when the user scrolls.
