In CSS animations, the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes 
over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time 
(your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over 
the course of the drive.

There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is ease, 
which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end. Other options include ease-out, 
which is quick in the beginning then slows down, ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the
end, or linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.

animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(x1,y1,x2,y2)
