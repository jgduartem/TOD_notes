Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

We can modify the width and height of an element using:

width:
height:

both in pixeles or percentages.

To make a text bold we can use the <strong> </strong> tag

To underline text we can use te <u> </u> tag

To italicize text we can use the <em> </em> tag

To stikethrough text we can use the <s> </s> tag

To create a horizontal line across the width of te element we can use the <hr> element
hr is a self-closing tag

The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.

The following table shows how the different text-transformvalues change the example text "Transform me".

Value	Result
lowercase	"transform me"
uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize	"Transform Me"
initial	Use the default value
inherit	Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none	Default: Use the original text
Transform the text of the h4 to be uppercase using the text-transform property.

The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.

///////////////////////////////////////////////
CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text.
As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.
