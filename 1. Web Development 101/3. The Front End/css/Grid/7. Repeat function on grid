When you used grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the structure of a grid, you entered a 
value for each row or column you created.

Let's say you want a grid with 100 rows of the same height. It isn't very practical to insert 100 values individually.
Fortunately, there's a better way - by using the repeat function to specify the number of times you want your 
column or row to be repeated, followed by a comma and the value you want to repeat.

Here's an example that would create the 100 row grid, each row at 50px tall.

grid-template-rows: repeat(100, 50px);
