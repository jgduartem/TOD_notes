The repeat function comes with an option called auto-fill. This allows you to automatically insert as many rows 
or columns of your desired size as possible depending on the size of the container. You can create flexible layouts 
when combining auto-fill with minmax, like this:

repeat(auto-fill, minmax(60px, 1fr));
When the container changes size, this setup keeps inserting 60px columns and stretching them until it can insert 
another one. Note: If your container can't fit all your items on one row, it will move them down to a new one.

auto-fit works almost identically to auto-fill. The only difference is that when the container's size exceeds the size 
of all the items combined, auto-fill keeps inserting empty rows or columns and pushes your items to the side, 
while auto-fit collapses those empty rows or columns and stretches your items to fit the size of the container.

Note: If your container can't fit all your items on one row, it will move them down to a new one.
