You have been adding id or class attributes to elements hat you wish to specifically style. 
These are known as ID and class selectors. There are other CSS Selectors you can use to select
custom groups of elements to style.

[attr=value] for example:

[type='radio']

if you set and !important declaration in the atribute you would be secure that this atribute will be
applied
