Default values:

If a parameter is not provided, the its value becomes undefined.

If we want to use a "default" text in this case, then we can specify it after =  /////Example////

function showMessage(from, text="no text given)

so, if in the call on the function we asing just one parameter, the second will use the "default" message

Naming a function
Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe 
what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does.

It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. 
There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes.

For instance, functions that start with "show" usually show something.

Function starting with…

"get…" – return a value,
"calc…" – calculate something,
"create…" – create something,
"check…" – check something and return a boolean, etc.
Examples of such names:

showMessage(..)     // shows a message
getAge(..)          // returns the age (gets it somehow)
calcSum(..)         // calculates a sum and returns the result
createForm(..)      // creates a form (and usually returns it)
checkPermission(..) // checks a permission, returns true/false
With prefixes in place, a glance at a function name gives an understanding what kind of work it does and 
what kind of value it returns.
