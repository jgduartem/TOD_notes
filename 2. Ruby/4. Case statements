Case statements process each condition in turn, and if the condition returns false, it will move onto the next one 
until a match is found. An else clause can be provided to serve as a default if no match is found.

grade = 'F'

did_i_pass = case grade #=> create a variable `did_i_pass` and assign the result of a call to case with the variable 
grade passed in
  
when 'A' then "Hell yeah!"
  when 'D' then "Don't tell your mother."
  else "McDonald's is hiring!"
end
As soon as a match is found, the value of that match is returned, and the case statement stops execution. 
Can you tell what the value of the did_i_pass variable is going to be after the case statement?

If you need to do some more complex code manipulation, you can remove the then keyword and instead place the 
code to be executed on the next line.

grade = 'F'

case grade
when 'A'
  puts "You're a genius"
  future_bank_account_balance += 5,000,000
when 'D'
  puts "Better luck next time"
  can_i_retire_soon = false
else
  puts "McDonald's is hiring!"
  fml = true
end
